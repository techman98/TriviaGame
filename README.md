# TriviaGame
My goal was to try to make the computer run a timer function, once the timer hit zero I wanted to count all the correct buttons pressed and all the incorrect or unselected radio button groups selected to be counted as incorrect and print that out to the webpage.

This project helps me to learn how to create time sensitive forms for real world applications.
