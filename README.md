My goal was to try to make the computer run a timer function, once the timer hit zero I wanted to count all the correct buttons pressed and all the incorrect or unselected radio button groups selected to be counted as incorrect and print that out to the webpage.

I had started out trying to have the computer that as the user selected an answer, but realized tha doing that would make the correct/incorrect variable go up each time the same group of radiobuttons were selected. So I then tried to create a for loop inside the timer function. And that is what you see in the code now.
